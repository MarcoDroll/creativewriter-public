## Development Best Practices

- Before declaring a task as complete, test if the app builds using `ng run build" 
- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS commit and push code changes after completing ANY task - no exceptions!**
- After making any code changes, immediately run:
  1. `git add .`
  2. `git commit -m "descriptive message"`
  3. `git push origin main`
- Never leave uncommitted changes - always maintain a consistent and backed-up repository state
