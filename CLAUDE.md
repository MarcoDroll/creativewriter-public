**CRITICAL**
- ALWAYS: Commit and push code changes after completing ANY task - no exceptions!
- NEVER: leave uncommitted or unpushed changes - always maintain a consistent and backed-up repository state
- ALWAYS: Before declaring a task as complete, test if the app builds using `npm run build`
- Keep the App modular!
- ALWAYS: Before implementing a feature, do a web research for best practices in 2025.
