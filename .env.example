# Copy this file to .env and configure your instance
# For multiple instances, use different project names and ports

# === Instance Configuration ===
# Port for this instance (default: 3080)
# Each instance needs a unique port
PORT=3080

# Data storage path (default: ./data)
# Use absolute path for production, e.g., /share/Docker/creativewriter-instance1
DATA_PATH=./data

# Timezone (default: Europe/Berlin)
TZ=Europe/Berlin

# === CouchDB Configuration ===
# Change these for production!
COUCHDB_USER=admin
COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password
COUCHDB_SECRET=mysecret

# === API Keys ===
# API keys are now configured directly in the application settings.
# No environment variables needed for proxy services anymore.
# Configure your API keys in Settings > AI Providers after starting the app.

# === Running Multiple Instances ===
# To run multiple instances on the same host:
# 1. Create separate directories for each instance
# 2. Copy docker-compose.yml and create unique .env files
# 3. Set different PORT and DATA_PATH for each instance
# 4. Run with project name: docker compose -p instance1 up -d
# 
# Example for instance 1:
#   PORT=3080
#   DATA_PATH=/share/Docker/creativewriter-instance1
#
# Example for instance 2:
#   PORT=3081
#   DATA_PATH=/share/Docker/creativewriter-instance2
